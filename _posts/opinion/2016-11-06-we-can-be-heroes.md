I remember

When the days were tough and I heard distant thunders

I was so afraid,I could not see what's right

I tried to find my path through the foggy night

But I could not see the light

Do you remember

When the sea was rough and we heard distant thunders

In my darkest hours you came into my life

Took me underneath your spreading wings

And taught me how to fly

There I was

A soldier without his sword

A lover with broken heart

Who lost his strength to carry on

A fighter fights his fight

A dreamer dreams his dream

But you and I we pull it through and lift up to the sky

A fighter fights his fight

A dreamer dreams his dream

But you and I we pull it through and lift up to the sky

Till our dreams come true

Cause we can be heroes

We can be heroes

We can be heroes

Sometimes

A fighter fights his fight

A dreamer dreams his dream

But you and I we pull it through and lift up to the sky

A fighter fights his fight

A dreamer dreams his dream

But you and I we pull it through and lift up to the sky

Till our dreams come true

Cause we can be heroes

We can be heroes

We can be heroes

Sometimes
